# FarmTech---Machine-Learning-Models-for-Accurate-Crop-Yield-Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict crop yields using historical agricultural data from 71 countries, covering 10 different crops from the years 1990 to 2013. The model incorporates multiple environmental and agricultural factors, such as area, yield (hg/ha), average rainfall, pesticide usage, and average temperature. By employing advanced machine learning algorithms and regression models, we forecast future yields, offering valuable insights for optimizing agricultural productivity and addressing global food security.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:
- **Area**: Cultivated area (in hectares)
- **Item**: Crop type (10 different crops)
- **Year**: Year of the record (1990â€“2013)
- **hg/ha_yield**: Crop yield in hectograms per hectare
- **average_rain_fall_mm_per_year**: Annual average rainfall (in millimeters)
- **pesticides_tonnes**: Amount of pesticides used (in tonnes)
- **avg_temp**: Average annual temperature (in Celsius)

## Algorithms Used
We implemented several machine learning algorithms to predict crop yields and compared their performance based on accuracy and Mean Squared Error (MSE):
1. **Linear Regression**:  
   - Accuracy: 7.37%  
   - MSE: 6.29 billion

2. **Random Forest**:  
   - Accuracy: 98.56%  
   - MSE: 97.65 million

3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:  
   - Accuracy: 28.82%  
   - MSE: 4.83 billion

4. **Decision Tree**:  
   - Accuracy: 97.61%  
   - MSE: 161.89 million

5. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**:  
   - Accuracy: 16.48%  
   - MSE: 5.67 billion

6. **XGBoost**:  
   - Accuracy: 97.43%  
   - MSE: 161.89 million

7. **Gradient Boosting**:  
   - Accuracy: 83.11%  
   - MSE: 161.89 million

## Interactive Power BI Dashboard
We developed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to visualize the data trends and patterns. This tool helps stakeholders explore the relationships between variables like average temperature, rainfall, pesticide use, and crop yield across different regions and time periods. The dashboard serves as a decision-making aid, enabling insights into global agricultural practices.

## Installation & Requirements

### Libraries and Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- TensorFlow (for ANN model)
- Power BI (for dashboard visualization)

## Results and Analysis
- **Best Performing Model**: Random Forest with 98.56% accuracy and an MSE of 97.65 million.  
- **Insightful Visualizations**: The Power BI dashboard presents key trends, such as the impact of rainfall and pesticide use on yield fluctuations across regions and crops.  
- **Model Comparisons**: While Random Forest and Decision Tree models showed high accuracy, ANN and KNN struggled due to the complexity of the dataset and non-linearity in the data.

## Impact
This project provides accurate yield predictions that can be used to optimize agricultural practices and policies, improving crop management, resource allocation, and global food security strategies. The models and dashboard enable researchers, policymakers, and farmers to make data-driven decisions, ultimately supporting sustainable agriculture.

## Future Work
- Enhance the models by incorporating more granular data (e.g., soil quality, crop rotation).
- Develop region-specific models for more localized yield predictions.
- Integrate real-time data for continuous crop monitoring and forecasting.
